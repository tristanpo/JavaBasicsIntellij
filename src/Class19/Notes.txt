Access Modifiers in Java:
access modifiers allow us to control tge visibility of class members(fields, methods, constructors etc.)and classes
itself in java.
There are 4 access levels and there are 3 keywords that we use to define these access
level fourth level is applier when we don't use any access modifier keyword.
levels from most restricted to less restricted are;
1)Private(keyword is also private)
2)Default(no keyword means default access level)
3)Protected(keyword is also protected)
4)Public(keyword is also public)
Rules:
1)we should always prefer private access modifier for the fields. Because fields contain data and the methods
of your class might use that data to perform some tasks if we don't perform sanity checks before
setting the values to these fields our classes and methods might misbehave also tge access of the data should be
restricted so that not every one can access the data.
2) we can't use access modifiers with local variables.

Constructors:
constructors in java allows us to set the values of the fields of a class.
