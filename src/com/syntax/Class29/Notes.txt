Set in Java:
set is an interface in collections framework which is implemented by many classes for example
HashSet, LinkedHashSet, and TreeSet.
Properties of Set:
All the Sets don't allow duplicates.
HashSet:
    1)HashSet does not maintain the insertion order.
    2) it is the fastest in all sets
    3)Most widely used set.
LinkedHashSet:
    1)Maintains the insertion order
    2)slower than HshSet but faster than TreeSet especially the insertion
TreeSet:
    1)sorts the data in natural order. for number in increasing order
    2)it is the slowest when it comes to store the data.
When to use which type of Set:
    1)if we don't care about insertion order and data being sorted always use HashSet
    2) if we need the insertion order we (Batch 12) don't have much choice we have to
    use the LinkedHashSet but if we don't care about the insertion order we can compare it with
    TreeSet
    LinkedHashSet      VS         TreeSet
    Insertion is not slow         Slowest insertion
    Retrieval is super slow       Slower than HashSet but faster than LinkedHashSet
I don't care about insertion order but, I care about retrieval speed which Set should I use? HashSet
I care about insertion order but, I don't care about retrieval speed which Set should I use? LinkedHashSet
if I want to have sorted data all the time?
TreeSet
