Method Overriding in java:
Method overriding happens when we have same name methods in parent and child class
classes.
Benefits
1)Flexibility if we don't like something from the parent class we can override it and can
provide our own implementation.
2)Same method can act differently depending upon the object on which we call it
Rules:
1)without inheritance method overriding is not possible.
2)method signature should be same in parent class and in child class.
3)if something does not participate in inheritance we can' override it constructors
and private methods
4)we can increase the visibility in the child classes but we can't decrease it for example we can go from default or
protected to public but we can't do the reverse
5)we can't override a static method, but we can redeclare it. for example main method can't be overridden as it is
static
6)We can't have different return type in child class it must be same as of parent class.
OOPS Main pillars:
1)Inheritance(code re-usability)
2)Polymorphism(less code dynamic code)
3)Abstraction()
4)Encapsulating()
