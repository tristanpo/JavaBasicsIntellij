inheritance in Java:
its a mechanism in java through which a child class gets the properties and methods from a parent class.
Benefits:
1)Saves time to code
2)code duplication is reduced
3)execution time is faster
Disadvantages:
CLasses are tightly coupled if we change something in parent class it is also changed in the child class.
Types of inheritance:
there are 4 types of inheritance but java only supports 3 of them
1)single
2)Hierarchical
3)Multilevel
4)multiple(not supported in java)
Single inheritance:
in single inheritance we have only one parent class. or only two classes participate in inheritance one as child
one as parent{

}
class Child extends Parent{
}
Hierarchical:
    In hierarchical inheritance we have a single parent class and multiple child classes.
class Parent{
}
class Child1 extends Parent{
}
class Child2 extends Parent{
}
Multilevel:
we have multipple levels of inheritance for example we have classes A B C class C will be inherited from B and b
will be inherited from B and b will be inherited from A.
Class A{
}
Class B extend A{
}
Class C extend B{
}
====================
super keyword:
Super keyword is like the "this" it refers to the parent class object. for example we can access the fields method or
constructors of parent classs inside the child class using this keyword.
