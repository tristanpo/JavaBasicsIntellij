Abstraction in java:
Hiding the implementation details and providing the functionality only. Two methods to achieve abstractions:
1) Abstract classes
2) interface
Abstract classes:
    Abstract classes are classes with abstract keyword.
Interfaces:
    Interfaces are the contracts that we create with the help of interface keyword.
How to decide which one to use:
1) Prefer the interfaces over the abstract classes.
2)if two or more classes are closely related to each other go with abstract classes for example if we have to create a
lion ti create a Lion class and a horse class we should go with abstract classes and should create an animal abstract class.
if two classes are not related to each other for example an Apple and a Cloth we should create an interface for that like if we
want to have a behavior WashAble.
Encapsulation:
it is the fourth pillar of OOPS. it provides security and better control over the data of a class.
we create classes and inside those classes we create private fields and methods.
these methods are classes getter setter methods and we set and get the values of the class fields with the help of these
methods instead of accessing and modifying them directly
