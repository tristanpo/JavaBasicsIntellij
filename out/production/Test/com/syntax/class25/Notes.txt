Abstract classses in java:
Abstract classes in java are the classes with abstract keyword. we use abstract classes
to achieve abstruction.
Abstractiob:
Is the process of hidden implementation details and only showing the functionality to
end user.
Advantages:
1) reduces the complexity.
2)improves the maintainability.
3) Can also enforce rules utp to a certain limit.
Disadvantages:
1) Classes get tightly coupled
2)
3)
class Dog{
String name;
static String int legs=4;
//concrete class
}

public abstract class Phone{
String make;
string model;
static boolean has5G=true;
}
Rules:
Abstract classes can have all the things that regular classes do, but we can't create
their objects directly and if a class is inheriting from the abstract class it must either
provide the implementation for the abstract method or it must be declared abstract
1) we can't have final and abstract keywords with a method
2) we can't have static and abstract keywords with a method at the same time.
3) abstract keyword with fields not allowed.
Interface:
Interfaces are also used to achieve abstraction in java
we can create an interface with the keyword interface.

interface Human{
public static final int legs=2;
public abstract void walk();

}
