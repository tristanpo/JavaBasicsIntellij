Super keyword:
super is keyword like "this" keyword,but it refers to the parent class object. we can use super
keyword in 3 different ways.
1)To access the super class variables if we have the same name variables in super class
and base class.
2) If we have same method names in parent and child class we can use the super keyword to access the parent class
method otherwise by default java refers to the child class methods.
3) As constructors don't participate in inheritance we can use super() to call the constructors from the parent
class.
Rules:
if we have a constructor in the parent class that takes two argument we must have a constructor inside the child class
that at least takes those two arguments.
2) We can't use this() and super() inside the same constructor
3) Super can't be used in static methods

Method overloading in java:
if we have the same name methods in a class with different number of parameters or different
sequence of parameters or different data types of the parameters it is called method overloading.
