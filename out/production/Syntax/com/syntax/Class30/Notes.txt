Maps in java:
Map is an interface that allows us to store the data in key value pairs.
Benefits:
    1)we can store two values inside the maps
    2) searching is very efficient in maps
Types of maps:
    1) HashMap 2) LinkedHashMap 3) TreeMap
HashMap:
    1)Insertion order is not maintained (downside)
    2)insertion and retrieval is fastest (upside)
LinkedHashMap
    1)Insertion order is maintained (upside)
    2)Insertion speed is same as HashMap but retrieval speed is slowest
TreeMap:
    1) Data is sorted in natural order by default.
    2) insertion speed is slowest but retrieval speed is better than linkedHashMap but slower
    than HashMap
Rules:
1)We can't convert a collection to a map for example we can't convert a set to a Map
2)Duplicate keys are not allowed in maps
3) Duplicate values are not allowed
Map<String,String> students=new Map<>()
students.put("Yaz123","Yazgul");
set<String> set=new HashSet(students)
