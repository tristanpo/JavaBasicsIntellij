Method overloading in Java:
When same method name exists in a class but with different number of parameters or different data type of
parameters or different sequence of parameters.
Advantages of method overloading:
Flexibility of having same name methods in a class
End user gets the benefit that he does not need to remember different method names
Rules:
we overload the constructors
we can overload the static methods as well
we can overload the mai method as well
Rules for static methods:
Static methods can't access instance fields directly
instance methods can access instance as well static fields
directly
Method overriding:
1)Method overriding happens when we have same name methods in the
parent class and in the child class
2)we can only override a method if we have inheritance between two
classes
3)we can't override the private methods because they don't participate
in inheritance
4)we can't override the constructors because they don't participate in
inheritance
