Maps in Java:
It's a data structure that allows us to store key value pairs.
    1) Searching is efficient.
    2) we can use any types of keys like Double String char etc. we are not restricted to integer
    based natural indexes

Retrieval:
Retrieval means getting back the data from a data structure
There are many types of maps but we will be discussing only four of them.
    1)HashMap
    2)LinkedHashMap
    3)TreeMap
    4)HashTable(old)
HashMap:
    1)HashMap is the fastest one when it comes to inserting and retrieving the data.
    2) insertion order is not maintained.
    3) Most widely used
LinkedHashMap:
    1)LinkedHashMap maintains the insertion order.
    2) Insertion speed is same as HashMap.
    3) Retrieval is the slowest one
TreeMap:
    1)Data is sorted based on the natural order.
    2)Insertion is slowest because of the sorting.
HashTable:
    IS a thread safe data means it can handle multiple insertions and retrievals at the same time
    from multiple CPU cores but because of thread safety feature it is also very slow
    so if you are sure that you will never write multithreaded code never use it
