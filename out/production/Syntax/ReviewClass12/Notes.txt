Encapsulation in Java:
    Encapsulation is hiding the class variables by making them private and providing the
    getter setter methods
Benefits:
    Better control over the data and security.
Collections Framework:
Collections framework is a collection of interfaces and classes which have many
methods to store and manipulate the data.
String name;
String name1;
String name2;
String[] names=new String[10];
Limitations of the array
    1)They are fixed in size once we have created an array we can't modify its size.
    2)Arrays don't have built-in methods.
Collections
    1)Dynamic in size.
    2) they have built-in methods to manipulate the data.
    3) Collections framework does not work with the primitive data types. we have
    to use the wrapper classes.
    4) when we convert the primitive data type to non-primitive we call it boxing
Boxing:
int num=10
Integer wrapper=new Integer(num); //boxing
Integer wrapper=num; //autoBoxing

Double d=new Double(25.5);
double num4=d.doubleValue(); //un-boxing
double num5=d; auto un=boxing
==================================
In java when we make a class inherit from another class we are already doing multiple inheritance because
object class is automatically inherited for all the classes.
