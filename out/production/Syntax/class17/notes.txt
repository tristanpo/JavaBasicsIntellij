types of variables:
there are 3 types of variables: Local, Instance, and static

Class Vars{
int age=10;//instance variable
static double weight=25.5;//static variable

void method(){
String name="Moreed";//local variable

}

}

Local Variables:
if a variable is defined inside a method or loop or switch or any other block of code
it is called local variable.

Instance Variables:
if a variable is not declared inside a method, but it is inside a class then it is called an instance variable.

Static Variable:
if a variable is nor declared inside a method but it is inside a class and it has static keyword with it then
it is called a static variable.

When to use which type of variables:
local variables:
local variables should always be preferred over instance and static variables why because
they occupy computers' memory for very, very short amount of time
as soon as their purpose is served Java destroys them.
Pros:
save memory
cons:
not accessible outside of methods/block of code

Instance Variable:
When we want to share something in multiple methods of a class and the information is expected to
be different from object to object we should go with the instance variables
pros:
accessible in all the methods of a class
Cons:
occupy computers' memory for longer than local variables

Static variables:
When we know that information will stay the same for all the objects of a class we should create
a static variable for that
Pros:
single memory location for all objects of a class
Cons:
stay longer in the memory
can hold only one value at a time
